# CSV Order Preservation Feature

## Summary

Modules now maintain their original CSV import order by default, allowing users to control module ordering through their CSV file structure.

## What Changed

### Before ❌
- Modules were automatically sorted alphabetically by name on import
- Users couldn't control the display order
- CSV row order was lost

### After ✅
- Modules maintain their CSV import order by default
- New "CSV Order" sort option (selected by default)
- Users can still sort by Name, Price, or Timeline if desired
- CSV row order is preserved

## Why This Matters

### Use Cases

1. **Priority-Based Ordering**
   ```csv
   Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
   Critical - Authentication,5,8,10,...
   Critical - Payment,7,10,15,...
   Important - Dashboard,4,12,8,...
   Nice-to-have - Settings,2,4,3,...
   ```
   Modules display in priority order (Critical → Important → Nice-to-have)

2. **Workflow-Based Ordering**
   ```csv
   Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
   1. Requirements,5,0,0,...
   2. Design,10,0,0,...
   3. Development,0,20,25,...
   4. Testing,0,5,5,...
   ```
   Modules display in development workflow order

3. **Phase-Based Ordering**
   ```csv
   Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
   Phase 1 - MVP Core,10,15,20,...
   Phase 1 - MVP Polish,5,8,6,...
   Phase 2 - Advanced Features,8,12,15,...
   Phase 3 - Optimization,3,5,7,...
   ```
   Modules grouped and ordered by development phase

4. **Custom Business Logic**
   - Client deliverables order
   - Team capacity planning
   - Budget allocation priority
   - Risk-based ordering (high-risk first)

## Implementation

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/features/ModuleList.tsx`

#### 1. Added 'default' Sort Option
```tsx
type SortOption = 'default' | 'name' | 'price' | 'timeline';
```

#### 2. Changed Default Sort
```tsx
// Before
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<SortOption>('name');

// After
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<SortOption>('default');
```

#### 3. Updated Sort Logic
```tsx
const sortedModules = useMemo(() => {
  // If default sort, maintain original CSV order
  if (sortBy === 'default') {
    return modules;
  }

  // Otherwise, apply selected sort
  const sorted = [...modules];
  // ... sorting logic
  return sorted;
}, [modules, sortBy, sortDesc, rates]);
```

#### 4. Added CSV Order Button
```tsx
<button onClick={() => handleSort('default')} ...>
  CSV Order
</button>
```

## User Interface

### Sort Controls (Before)
```
Sort by: [Name ↑] [Price] [Timeline]
```

### Sort Controls (After)
```
Sort by: [CSV Order] [Name] [Price] [Timeline]
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
         Active by default
```

### Behavior

**CSV Order Button:**
- Active by default (highlighted)
- No sort direction indicator (maintains original order)
- Click to return to CSV order after sorting by another field

**Other Sort Buttons:**
- Click once: Sort ascending
- Click twice: Sort descending
- Click third time on same button: Toggle direction
- Click different button: Switch to that sort (ascending)

## Examples

### Example 1: Priority Order Preserved

**CSV File:**
```csv
Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
Authentication,5,8,10,...
Payment Processing,7,10,15,...
User Dashboard,4,12,8,...
Settings,2,4,3,...
```

**Display Order (CSV Order - Default):**
1. Authentication
2. Payment Processing
3. User Dashboard
4. Settings

**Display Order (Name Sort):**
1. Authentication
2. Payment Processing
3. Settings
4. User Dashboard

Users can click "CSV Order" to return to priority order.

### Example 2: Development Phases

**CSV File:**
```csv
Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
Infrastructure,0,0,10,...
Database Schema,5,0,8,...
API Layer,3,0,15,...
Frontend UI,7,20,0,...
Integration,0,5,5,...
```

**CSV Order (Default):**
Shows development workflow in sequence

**Timeline Sort:**
Shows longest modules first (useful for resource planning)

Users can toggle between workflow view (CSV Order) and effort view (Timeline Sort).

### Example 3: Numbered Modules

**CSV File:**
```csv
Module,Design (days),Front-end (days),Back-end (days),...
1. Requirements Analysis,5,0,0,...
2. UI/UX Design,10,0,0,...
3. Backend Development,0,0,25,...
4. Frontend Development,0,20,0,...
5. Testing & QA,0,5,5,...
```

**CSV Order (Default):**
Maintains numbered sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

**Name Sort:**
Would maintain same order (alphabetical by number prefix)

## Testing

### Automated Tests

**New Test File:** `src/test/moduleSortOrder.test.ts` (8 tests)

Tests cover:
- ✅ CSV order preservation
- ✅ Priority ordering scenarios
- ✅ Workflow ordering scenarios
- ✅ Numbered module names
- ✅ Custom business logic ordering
- ✅ Difference from alphabetical sort
- ✅ Difference from price sort
- ✅ Difference from timeline sort

**Test Results:**
```
✓ 149 tests passing (up from 141)
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Import CSV with custom order:**
   ```bash
   # Use test-csvs/13-valid-comprehensive.csv
   # Note the original order in the CSV
   ```

2. **Verify CSV order:**
   - Modules should display in CSV row order
   - "CSV Order" button should be highlighted

3. **Test sort toggling:**
   - Click "Name" - modules sort alphabetically
   - Click "CSV Order" - return to original CSV order
   - Click "Price" - modules sort by cost
   - Click "CSV Order" - return to original CSV order

4. **Test with different CSVs:**
   - `02-design-only.csv` - Design modules in order
   - `03-development-only.csv` - Dev modules in order
   - Create custom CSV with numbered modules

## Benefits

### For Users

✅ **Control:** Users control module display order via CSV structure
✅ **Flexibility:** Can still sort by Name, Price, Timeline when needed
✅ **Intuitive:** CSV row order matches display order
✅ **Professional:** Maintain business-logical ordering for proposals
✅ **Reversible:** Can always return to CSV order with one click

### For Different Use Cases

**Project Managers:**
- Order by priority for stakeholder reviews
- Order by phase for timeline discussions
- Order by team for resource allocation

**Sales Teams:**
- Order by value for proposals
- Order by client priority
- Order by quick wins first

**Development Teams:**
- Order by technical dependencies
- Order by sprint planning
- Order by complexity (tackle hard first)

## Migration

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing functionality preserved
- All existing tests pass
- Only default behavior changed
- Users can immediately sort by Name if preferred

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ All sort options still work
- ✅ Sort direction toggle preserved
- ✅ No data structure changes
- ✅ No API changes

## Files Changed

1. **src/components/features/ModuleList.tsx**
   - Added 'default' sort option
   - Updated default sort state
   - Modified sort logic to preserve CSV order
   - Added "CSV Order" button

2. **src/test/moduleSortOrder.test.ts** (NEW)
   - 8 comprehensive tests for sort order preservation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**
   - Allow manual reordering in UI
   - Save custom order to localStorage

2. **Custom Sort Persistence**
   - Remember user's preferred sort
   - Save per-project or globally

3. **Sort by Custom Field**
   - Allow CSV to include priority/phase column
   - Sort by that custom field

4. **Export Maintains Order**
   - When exporting to CSV
   - Maintain current display order

## Summary

The CSV Order preservation feature gives users complete control over how their project modules are displayed, while maintaining the flexibility to sort by other criteria when needed. This is particularly valuable for:

- Client-facing proposals (priority/value order)
- Team planning (workflow/phase order)
- Resource allocation (dependency/complexity order)
- Custom business logic (any order that matters to the user)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested (149/149 tests passing)
**Version:** Added in v1.2.0
**Impact:** UI enhancement, no breaking changes
