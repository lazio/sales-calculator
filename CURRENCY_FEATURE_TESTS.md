## Manual Testing Checklist

In addition to automated tests, the following should be manually verified:

### Currency Toggle
- [ ] Click currency symbol in Total Quote
- [ ] Verify all prices change from $ to €
- [ ] Click again to toggle back to $
- [ ] Verify Monthly Rates show correct currency
- [ ] Verify Module prices show correct currency
- [ ] Copy summary and verify currency in clipboard
- [ ] Copy markdown and verify currency

### Visible Rates
- [ ] Import CSV with 3 performers
- [ ] Verify only 3 rates shown
- [ ] Import different CSV with 2 performers
- [ ] Verify only 2 rates shown (old ones hidden)
- [ ] Import first CSV again
- [ ] Verify rates restored with saved values
- [ ] Change a rate value
- [ ] Import different CSV and back
- [ ] Verify rate change persisted

### Blank Field Handling
- [ ] Clear a rate input field completely
- [ ] Verify it stays blank (not "0")
- [ ] Verify placeholder shows
- [ ] Type new value
- [ ] Verify it saves correctly

   - Multi-CSV workflow with rate persistence

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Large CSV files (100+ modules)
   - Many rates (50+ performers)

3. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Keyboard navigation to currency toggle
   - Screen reader announcements

   - Currency symbol rendering across browsers
   - LocalStorage behavior across browsers

## Conclusion

The currency toggle and visible rates features have comprehensive test coverage with 33 new automated tests covering:

- All display locations (QuoteSummary, ModuleList, RateConfiguration)
- All export formats (text, markdown)
- Type safety and defaults
- Edge cases and error handling
- LocalStorage persistence
- Component integration

**All 182 tests passing** ✅
